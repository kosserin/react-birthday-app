# React Birthday App

Project from freecodecamp that I modified adding some new functionality to it. The project has local data about users and their birthdays and that data is being rendered to the list that is displayed. If the person's birthday date is equal to today date, then that person is displayed as first with a little bit bolder text and bigger image. If there's no birthday today, then it's displayed "You have 0 birthdays today." By clicking on each list item that is displayed, user can remove each person from the list, or just by clicking Clear all to remove all birthdays. User can also add new birthday clicking on Add birthday button and filling form to add. Image url has default image so if user doesn't enter anything, the default image will be displayed.
